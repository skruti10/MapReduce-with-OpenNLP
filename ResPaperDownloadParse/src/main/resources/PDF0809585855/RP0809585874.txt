re-
pare the condensate on the negative scattering length
side of the resonance, the field was stepped up to 913 G
as quickly as possible (? 1 µs) to jump through the
resonance with minimal atom loss. The field was then
ramped back down to 903 G in 50 µs to form molecules.
In order to remove non-paired atoms from the trap, the
sample was irradiated with a 20 µs pulse of resonant light.
Because 903 G is far from the Feshbach resonance, the
mixing between atomic and molecular states was small,
and therefore molecules were transparent to this “blast”
pulse. By ramping the field back to 913 G molecules were
converted back to atoms. Absorption images were taken
at high fields (either at 903 G or 913 G) after 10 to 17 ms
ballistic expansion, with the imaging light incident along
the axial direction of the condensate.

To study the momentum distribution of the back-
converted atoms, the magnetic field was ramped up im-
mediately after turning off the optical trap, or for a refer-
ence, at the end of the ballistic expansion. The difference
between the energies of ballistic expansion is the he width of the Feshbach resonance as a free pa-
rameter to obtain a fitted value of ?B = 1.07 ± 0.02 G
(dotted line in Fig. 2). Compared to previous mean-field
measurements [15, 22], our determination of the reso-
nance width is more accurate and free from systematic
errors associated with the determination of ats, 1093280
